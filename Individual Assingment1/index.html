  <p1> <strong>Good day, evening, or wherever you are in the world!</strong><br> 
    I hope this page finds you well. I am selling a series of prized possessions currently under my ownership. 
    These items have grown in value throughout the years and have given me unprecedented joy and happiness, 
    not because of the current market value or demand. It is because these items represent memories. 
    They highlight the point where I grew and describe my priceless experiences. </p1> <br>
    <br>

 <p2>These items are snowboard collections that where used and singed by professional snowboarders. By the  
    <em> Best backcountry snowboarders in the world. Signed, hand built, and limited in quantity.</em> <strong> These boards will perform anywhere on the slopes!</strong>
        <strong>Bindings not included but will supply at extra cost.</strong>
</p2> 
<br>

<br>
<p3> Unfortunately, I am in a pickle and need some financial boost to advance my college career. 
    Selling these items will help give me the tools to excel and perform in academia. 
    I don't want to sell them. However, I have the best memories with them, which is good enough for me. 
    I hope whoever buys these items will share the stories that come with these items. And build new memories with them.
    I hope you will take care and cherish them as much as I did for the reasons highlighted below. 
    The Items are as listed in order; kindly contact me for questions and prices These will be sold to the <em>highest bidder.</em><br>
